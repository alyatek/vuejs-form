## Purpose

---

Inspired by a data centric approach this forms & form validation package (Inspired by Laravel) is completely decoupled from any component or UI library/package.


In fact, Vuejs Form _**works with any**_
- Ui Component Package (Element UI, Vuetify, Keen UI, etc...)
- Reactive Framework (Vue, React, Angular)
- Within Vanilla Javascript

Vuejs Form's _**zero dependency**_ setup enables seamless integration into just about any javascript setup.

Supporting _**Four Official Api's**_, the ability to create conversationally readable, flexibly dynamic, & simply powerful forms is easier than ever --- without losing any benefits of your current implementation of preferred setup.
